# IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project Documentation:

## Overview
In the project [Technology Trends and Demographic Analysis](https://github.com/DariiaSira/IBM-Data-Analyst-Capstone-Project/blob/main/Technology%20Trends%20and%20Demographic%20Analysis.pdf) I utilized IBM Cognos Analytics to create a comprehensive dashboard with three interconnected tabs. Each tab focused on analyzing and presenting data from a subset of the 2019 Stack Overflow Developer Survey. The aim was to explore current technology usage, predict future trends, and analyze developer demographics using various visualization techniques.

## Tools and Data Used
- **Tool**: IBM Cognos Analytics
- **Datasets**:
  - `m5_survey_data_demographics.csv`
  - `m5_survey_data_technologies_normalised.csv`

The datasets provided insights into developer technologies, future aspirations, and demographic details.

## Key Steps in the Project
1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Downloaded and uploaded the datasets into Cognos Analytics as data assets.

2. **Dashboard Design**:
   - Created three dashboard tabs using a 2x2 rectangle template:
     - **Current Technology Usage:** Focused on the top technologies developers worked with.
     - **Future Technology Trend:** Highlighted technologies developers aspire to learn or use next year.
     - **Demographics:** Explored demographic data filtered for "Man" and "Woman" categories.

3. **Visualization Implementation**:
   - Utilized various chart types to represent metrics effectively.


# Conclusion

I completed the IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project, applying skills like data wrangling, analysis, visualization, and dashboard creation. Using tools like Jupyter Notebooks, SQL, and IBM Cognos Analytics, along with Python libraries (Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, etc.), I analyzed real-world datasets and presented findings in a comprehensive report with actionable insights for stakeholders. This project highlights my ability to manage data and deliver professional analytics solutions.
